In this project we can train a model of Deep learning using BiLSTM and integrated BiLSTM and CNN model which can perform sentiment analysis of the dataset.
We can use python libraries for obtaining and cleaning the dataset for training puroposes.
after that we can also use some libraries and methods for data visualization to known about the dataset which can be used for training model.
we can import sequential model and intialize the model for further processing after that we can go for model training in which we can run 7 epochs in different batch sizes.
we can also save the model and print the classification report which will give us the model accuracy
in our both model we can achieve 96% and 98% of training accuracy respectively and 90% and 91% of validation accuracy respectively.
